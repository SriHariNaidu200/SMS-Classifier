# SMS-Classifier
Task-1:SMS Classifier

Introduction:

In today’s world, we get lots of text messages, and many of them are spam. This is a great chance for anyone new to data science to learn something useful. Let’s explore how to create a machine learning model to detect spam in SMS messages. This project is ideal for beginners who want to get into Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning

The Project Objective:

Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can correctly tell whether an SMS message is spam or not. This project is a great way to start learning about text classification and natural language processing (NLP).

Gathering the Data:

We'll start with the "SMS Spam Collection Dataset," which you can find in my GitHub repository. This dataset contains SMS messages that are labeled as either 'spam' or 'ham' (not spam).

Tools of the Trade:

We’ll use Python, along with libraries like pandas for managing data, scikit-learn for building the machine learning model, and NLTK for processing the text.

Conclusion and Next Steps:

This project offers beginners a practical introduction to machine learning and NLP. As you gain confidence, you can explore advanced techniques like text normalization (stemming, lemmatization) and TF-IDF vectorization. The world of data science is vast and exciting, and projects like this are a great first step toward mastering it.
